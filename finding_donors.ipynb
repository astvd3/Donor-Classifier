    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature.

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",

    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "1- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "An SVM based classifier based on a set of features which can classify the two entities into two classes can be used at many places. One such example is for the government two classify people based on their incomes two define the welfare plans. The strength of the SVM is it finds the perfect decision boundary two separate two classes. The disadvantage is it can be tricky to find the appropriate kernel function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Decision trees are good for complex datasets. Like in this data set, weather forecasting is done using decision trees which I think is really a suitable example for decision trees. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.403.3726&rep=rep1&type=pdf The weather forecast is done by providing the set of very complex weather data to its decision vector pulling out the output of the forecast. Where Logistic regression fails to deal with these kind of datasets, decision trees fits really well with the non linearity, with added disadvantage of overfitting. But that can be overcome by keeping a moderate complexity of the tree. I am picking this model as I wanted to do the comparison between logistic regression and decision trees. As both models are independently good and even after visualising the dataset, I am very unsure if it can be solved with a simple decision boundary or the complex one. The result of this experiment will surely help us to decide which one is good for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "3- K-Nearest Neighbors as I wanted to go for an instance based approach for the dataset. The students must have a trend where they fail/pass due to their some other tendancy. This trend can be observed by memorising the whole dataset and then approximating them using their nearest neighboring datapoints. In this example, http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148108002358 The power produced by wind farms is being predicted using this K-NN model. This is really a good approach as you already have the information about the power from the reading and information about the weather. You can easily plug it to make it predict the power in future. Disadvantage of this model can be it requires a big memory to hold the data. It can be made fast depending on the search algorithm used. The K value is also supposed to be tuned well as lower K may overfit the data and higher K may make it go underfitted. But the model is good when you don't want any learning process to occur. But you need to be careful while assuming if you have enough data for this kind of model or not. Less data in some cases may make it entirely useless."

    "**Answer: ** F_score as it deals with both the precision and recall is a good metric for this dataset. It is good for this model as the classes are not equal in size. The F_score is larger for both the training and testing scale and different training samples too. Also the training time is the least for the Decision Tree classifier. Also the multiple factors tells us about higher non-linearity in the data. Decision trees are great to handle the non-linearities in the data. Thus the decision tree classifier is the best model to work with the classifier"

    "**Answer: ** Decision Trees classifier works with the 'decide and operate' principle. Like in our mind for some scenarios we are programmed to perform in a way, 'if this thing happens, do this'. The decision trees are exactly the same thing but can be very much multilayered and really dense. There can be stages after stages where from the previous decision we move ahead with some other decision. This principal we are going to use to classify sthe donors into higher earning and lower earning classes. The model can be trained using some conditions to seperate the donors in the above two classes. And once it is adjusted in that manner, it will be ready for the prediction."

    "**Answer:** The factors were not really similar to what I considered in the earlier question. There is more correlation to the maritial status than the age factor thus the ranking was reversed. This close correlation is understood as explained in the earlier question. The loose correlation between the age can be considered due to the higher salaries that people earn these days in a very young age for example the guy in some startup will be earning a lot than a person who was working in some company for say 20 years. Thus the observation makes sense."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:** There was only a little difference in this case.Accuracy and F_score were reduced by the factor of 0.003 and 0.0006 for both the cases, so the difference isn't much. The training time will be lower in the case of reduced data for sure. But it all depends about the precision we want from the model and the time it takes to train. For example, the data is huge and you need real time outputs then it makes sense to deal with reduced data with less time to train, but when we want accurate results it is always better to take in factor as many features as we need to generalise the model with the data."
